#Web Infrastructure Flow explanation: One Server Hosting www.foobar.com

#1.User Accesses Website:

#	A user types in the URL "www.foobar.com" in their web browser.

#2.Domain Name Resolution:

#	The user's computer initiates a DNS lookup to translate "www.foobar.com" into an IP address.
#	The DNS server responds with the IP address 8.8.8.8.

#3.User Reaches Web Server:

#	User's request reaches the server with IP 8.8.8.8.

#4.Web Server (Nginx):

#	Nginx acts as a reverse proxy and handles incoming HTTP requests.
#	It can also serve static files directly to the user.
#	Nginx forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

#5.Application Server:

#	The application server (e.g., using Node.js, Python, etc.) processes dynamic requests.
#	It interacts with the application files (your code base) to generate dynamic content.
#	It sends queries to the database to fetch or store data.

#6.Database (MySQL):

#	The database stores and manages structured data, like user accounts, posts, etc.
#	Application server communicates with the database using SQL queries.
#	MySQL manages data integrity, indexing, and querying.

#7.User Receives Response:

#	The application server generates a dynamic response.
#	The web server sends the response back to the user's browser.
#	Communication with User:

The communication between the server (8.8.8.8) and the user's computer happens over the internet using the HTTP protocol.
Data packets are transmitted back and forth through routers and switches.

#		Issues with the Infrastructure:

#1.Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

#	Since there's only one server, if it goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.
#	This includes issues with the server hardware, software crashes, etc.

#2.Downtime During Maintenance:

#	When maintenance is needed, like deploying new code or updating the server, the web server might need to be restarted.
#	During this time, the website could be temporarily unavailable.

#3.Scalability Concerns:

#	With only one server, handling a sudden influx of traffic can be challenging.
#	The infrastructure doesn't easily allow scaling to meet higher demands.

#4.Limited Fault Tolerance:

#	A failure in any component (web server, app server, database) could disrupt the entire service.
